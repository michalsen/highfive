# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them. A route
# maps a URL path to a controller. It defines with what function or method will
# be called when a URL is accessed.

# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# highfive.menu_links.yml file.

# If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=highfive , the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\highfive\Controller\HighFiveController") and a method
# ("tutorial").

# Notice that the user must have the permission we defined in highfive.permissions.yml
# with the machine name of 'access highfive demo'.

#          - Use permission of 'give highfives', which needs to be defined in highfive.permissions.yml
